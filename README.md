jsonpathesm is a Typescript-supported ES Module based version of [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/index.html#e2).

JSONPath [playground](http://jsonpath.com/).

There are competing libraries available, but JSONPath seems to be on the smaller size, and seems fairly robust.

**NB:** This library might not be "thread safe".  I seem to get sporadic results sometimes.
